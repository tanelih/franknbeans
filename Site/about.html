	<h1>About</h1>

		<h2>Goals</h2>

		<p>
			Frank N Beans is a Guild Wars 2 guild which aspires to create an active
			community of players. We do not intend to create a hardcore guild which
			requires extreme attendance, our only real requirement is that you enjoy
			playing the game and experiencing the various things that it has to offer.
		</p>

		<p>
			We try to shy away from the usual PvE/PvP guild mentality, instead focusing on
			whatever we find fun at the moment. We do not require members to commit to this
			idea of experiencing everything: fe. an active player who mainly enjoys structured
			PvP is welcome in our guild. So if you feel like you'd enjoy our company, send us
			in-game and introduce yourself!
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>

		<p>
			The guild leadership has been playing together for quite a while now, 
			dating all the way back to the beta of World of Warcraft. While we do
			not possess experience from Guild Wars 1, we do have a record of other MMO's
			under our belt.
